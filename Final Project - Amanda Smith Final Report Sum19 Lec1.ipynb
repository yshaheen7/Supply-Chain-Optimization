    "A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers which together aim to produce and distribute a product or goods. This network includes different activities, people, entities, data, and resources [1]. A supply chain company is involoved in many steps along its way to deliver the final product, including but not limited to receiving orders from customers, developing and creating the product, marketing, shipping and distribution, and other managment tasks like accounting, finance, customer support, etc. Thus, A supply chain company tries to integrate these processes in the most efficient way, in order to reduce the cost of manufacturing and stay competitive in a global market. \n",
    "\n",
    "DNEE (Does Not Exist Electronics) a supply chain company, decided to go in the market for manufacturing and distributing the most sought after electronic products, due to increasing demand for electronic products around the world. As a result, DNEE hires a team of engineers to come up with an optimization model to help the company minimize the cost of both manufacturing the product and distributing it around the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "DNEE tells its engineers that the company would like to optimize the two major processes it is involved in. The first part starts at the manufacturer, and tha goal is to reduce the cost of manufacturing by figuring out the optimal duration of making the product. Once the product is ready to be shipped, the second optimization model kicks in. That is to reduce the cost of delivering the products from the company's warehouses to each of the distribution centers. It is worth noting that the second stage will not deal with shipping the product to its final destination, i.e. shipping the product from the distribution center to the final customer. Instead, it will tackle the problem of figuring out how many and how big the warehouses needs to be, to reduce the overall cost of delivering products to the distributing centers while meeting their customer demand from all around the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our model for a supply chain, we assume that DNEE has access to specific parts needed for manufacturing the final product. Each of the parts has a cost that is included in the making of that step. We assume that the number of distribution centers that is given can not be changed, but we may change the number of warehouses as long as we meet the demand of all of the distribution centers. We also assume that the demand data is given to us based on DNEE’s projected sales of a single product, and that various electronic products will be of the same or similar demand. \n",

    "## A. Stage 1: Assembly Line Optimization ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage is to help DNEE to figure out how to optimize the efficiency of the assembly line so that the total cost during the assembly process can be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the optimization, we know the assembly tasks, each task's duration, and their precedence relationship. Additionally, due to the technical limitations, each task has a minimum duration which is possible to be realized.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of cost that DNEE should take into account. One is the time cost. For each product, if the total assembly time is x minutes, the time cost will be x units. The other cost is the improvement cost, which is the money spent on reducing the tasks' durations. To reduce the duration of a task by t minutes, DNEE has to pay t^2 units cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve this problem by trading off between minimizing the time cost and the improvement cost. There may be more than one practical way to solve it, and we come up with two solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ In the first solution, we firstly caculate the current critical path of the assmbly line, and then only consider reducing the durations of tasks on the critical path.\n",
    "+ In the second solution, we consider reducing the durations of all tasks as long as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing the solution, we assume that the two solutions will yield the same results."

    "In conclusion, by looking at the solutions for the above two stages, DNEE can reduce total cost of its supply chain model by following these recommendations: First, minimize the cost of each of the given manufacturing steps involved in making the product. Then, optimize the order of those steps by finding the critical path with the least cost, as show above in the second part of the first stage. Second, DNEE should invest in building only four warehouses around the world. And to meet the demand, it should addapt the suggested number of orders per route to transfer products between warehouses and distribution centers. Further, we found that increasing the capacity of some warehouses, like the one in Chicago and reducing others, like the one in Hongkong lowers cost of shipping even more. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, delivering products to their final destination is not done by DNEE. Instead, DNEE outsources this task to local parcel-delivery service or postal office. Our third and final recommendation for DNEE, should they consider future optimization, is to employ their own delivery trucks fleet out of each distributioin center. We suggest that they use the traveling salesman-problem (TSP) model to cut on the delivery cost to consumers. In such a model, we would assume that trucks start from the distribution center, visit a set of customers in a specific order, and then come back to the distribution center. Hence, the optimization model would handle shipping products to the end consumers from any of distribution center that have a feasible shipping route, while minimizing the total shipping cost (number of trucks per distribution center, gas cost, trip time, number of employees a day or labor hours etc.) \n"
