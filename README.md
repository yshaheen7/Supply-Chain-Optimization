# SupplyChainOptimization

This is a group project for Intro to Optimization course, Summer 2019.

In this project, my team and I create a supply chain-company optimzation model to minimize cost of production and distribution of products.

It is writtern in Julia and utilizes Jupyter Notebook. [Click here to access the report](https://github.com/yshaheen7/Supply-Chain-Optimization/blob/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Amanda%20Smith%20Final%20Report%20Sum19%20Lec1.ipynb)
